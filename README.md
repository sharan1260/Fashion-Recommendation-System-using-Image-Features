# Fashion-Recommendation-System-using-Image-Features
This project demonstrates how to build a Fashion Recommendation System that leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to analyze visual aspects of fashion items such as color, texture, and style, and recommend similar or complementary products. It utilizes pre-trained CNN models to extract powerful feature representations from fashion images, which are then used to find and recommend similar items.
Features:
1. Deep Learning: Utilizes VGG16, a pre-trained CNN model, for robust feature extraction.
2. Image Processing: Processes fashion images to fit model requirements.
3. Similarity Measurement: Uses cosine similarity to find the closest matches based on visual features.
4. Fashion Dataset: Works with a diverse dataset of fashion items to ensure varied recommendations.
